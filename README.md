Take home interview project.


Build a small web based application that has a set of predefined usernames and password an authorized user can log in to see a welcome screen of some kind.

Backend:

·      Use the language you are most comfortable with (Node, Python, Ruby, PHP)

·      You may use a hardcoded object to simulate the table of usernames and passwords in place of a database.

·      The backend should present a RESTful API with endpoints for:

·      Validating user credentials.

·      Getting a message only if you’re an authenticated user.


Frontend:

·      Use a JavaScript framework (React, Angular 1, Angular 2, Backbone, Meteor).

·      Must be a single page web app.

·      A login page.

·      A welcome page for authenticated users.

·      A message to inform a user their credentials are invalid.

·      Some CSS, Less or SCSS styling, have fun and be creative.
